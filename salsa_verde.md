## Salsa Verde

This is a salsa made using char-broiled tomatillos, peppers, onions

### Equipment
* Oven with a broiler
* Baking sheet/pan
* Food processor or blender


### Ingredients
* 6-12 tomatillos
* Onion (any type)
* Peppers (If you like your salsa spicy, choose hotter peppers, but any will do)
* 1-2 cloves of garlic
* salt (1-2 teaspoons)
* olive oil (substitute with any oil, although if your smoke detector is sensative, you may want to substitute with an oil with a higher smoke point such as sunflower oil)

### Instructions
Cover the baking tray with aluminum foil (this makes cleanup much easier. If you're out of alumninum foil skip this step)
Dehusk tomatillos
Rinse tomatillos with water
Half the tomatillos along their sides and place them on the baking tray with tops and bottoms up (the sliced part should be on the bottom of the tray
For large peppers (such as bell peppers) slice in half and add to tray
Add all other ingredients to the tray
Add oil and salt to the veggies. Try to get these evenly distributed
Put under the broiler for 12 minutes
Take the sheet pan. The veggies should have a nice char on them
Put into a food processor (likely in batches). Add some salt to each batch
Optionally you can add a 2-3 raw cloves of garlic
Once blended pour into a large jar
Either use immediately or cover and put into the fridge
